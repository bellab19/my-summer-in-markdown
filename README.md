# ***Summer 2024 ---*** Bella

## *Introduction!*

### Hello! My name is Bella and this is my thrid year at Chatsworth, making me a junior. Some basic information about me is that I really enjoy listening to music and watching shows/movies. 

## *Fun Fact*
### A fun fact about me is that my parents decided that me and my sisters middle name would be colors, making my middle name blue and my sisters grey!

## *Family Traditions*
### My family as a whole don't really have traditions, however my immediate family and one of my aunts and her family like to take annual camping trips by a beach that are very peaceful and memorable. 

## *Summer Activities*
### Although personally this summer wasn't very entertaining, I still had some nice memories. One being going to the beach with my family and rewatching some old shows/movies along with starting some new ones. 

## *Favorite Watch*
### I have mentioned many times throughout this introduction I enjoy consuming media in forms of shows and movies but one movie I noticed I kept watching again and again is a movie called Watching the Detectives.
